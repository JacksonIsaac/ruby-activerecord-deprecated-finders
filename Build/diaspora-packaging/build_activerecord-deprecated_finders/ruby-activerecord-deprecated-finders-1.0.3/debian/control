Description: Ruby gem to deprecate finder option hashes
 extracted from Active Record.
 .
 The activerecord-deprecated_finder is a deprecated finder API
 that is extracted from Active Record.This Ruby library
 will be used to extract and deprecate old-style finder
 option hashes in Active Record. To provide deprecated
 functionality it will be a dependency of Rails 4.0. It will
 be removed as a dependency in Rails 4.1,
 but it can be manually included in Gemfile and
 it will continue to be maintained until Rails 5.
